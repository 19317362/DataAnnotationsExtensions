Validation extensions for DataAnnotations.  This project intends to provide common validation attributes (email, url, min/max, etc) which extend ASP.NET DataAnnotations.  

The core library will provide server-side validation attributes that can be used in any .NET 4.0 project (no Mvc dependency).  There will also be an easily pluggable client-side validation library which can be used in ASP.NET MVC 3 projects.

All validation attributes will be covered with unit tests and will also have a dedicated controller in the included sample website.

Please see the project wiki at https://github.com/srkirkland/DataAnnotationsExtensions/wiki for current development status, with more information coming soon.
